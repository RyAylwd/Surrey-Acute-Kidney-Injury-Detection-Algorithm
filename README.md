# Surrey-Acute-Kidney-Injury-Detection-Algorithm
## A Python implementation of Surrey Acute Kidney Injury Detection Algorithm

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a rapid deterioration in kidney function based on the rate
of change in a patient’s estimated glomerular filtration values. This is a code for
alternative automated approaches for detecting AKI, i.e., novel Surrey AKI detection algorithm (SAKIDA)

We introduced a novel algorithm “SAKIDA” to detect AKIs from the primary care data. The
proposed SAKIDA performs better than GPR and NHS England algorithms in the primary care
settings with 70% accuracy. GPR and NHS England are more suitable in real-time systems e.g.,
in secondary care settings.
